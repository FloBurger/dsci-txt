## I) Strings (String.format())

### 1) Find the Integral (8 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/59811fd8a070625d4c000013>

**Tags:** Fundamentals

**Instruction:**

Create a function that finds the integral of the expression passed.

In order to find the integral all you need to do is add one to the exponent (the second argument), and divide the
coefficient (the first argument) by that new number.

For example for 3x^2, the integral would be 1x^3: we added 1 to the exponent, and divided the coefficient by that new
number).

Notes:

The output should be a string.
The coefficient and exponent is always a positive integer.

**Examples:**

	 3, 2  -->  "1x^3"
	12, 5  -->  "2x^6"
	20, 1  -->  "10x^2"
	40, 3  -->  "10x^4"
	90, 2  -->  "30x^3"

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def integrate(coefficient, exponent):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(integrate(90,2))
```

### 2) Take the Derivative (8 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/5963c18ecb97be020b0000a2>

**Tags:** Fundamentals

**Instructions:**

This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, and the second number being
the exponent.

Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. Then, it has to print out an
expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be truncated when exponent = 2.

**Example:**

	derive(7, 8)

In this case, the function should multiply 7 and 8, and then subtract 1 from 8. It should output "56x^7", the first
number 56 being the product of the two numbers, and the second number being the exponent minus 1.

	derive(7, 8) --> this should output "56x^7" 
	derive(5, 9) --> this should output "45x^8" 

Notes:

The output of this function should be a string
The exponent will never be 1, and neither number will ever be 0

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def derive(coefficient, exponent): 
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(derive(5,9))
```

```

### 10) Printer Errors (7 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/56541980fa08ab47a0000040>

**Tags:** Fundamentals

In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the
sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be
aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time
color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g.
aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string
representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

**Examples:**

	s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
	error_printer(s) => "0/14"

	s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
	error_printer(s) => "8/22"

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def printer_error(s):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
s = "aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
print(printer_error(s))
```

### 11)Two to One (7 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/5656b6906de340bd1b0000ac/python>

**Tags:** Fundamentals

**Instructions:**

Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from ato z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters,
each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

**Examples:**

	a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
	b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
	longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

	a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
	longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def longest(a1, a2):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a1 = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
a2 = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
print(longest(a1, a2))
```

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a4b16435f08299c7000274f>

**Tags:** Fundamentals

**Instructions:**

Complete the function that takes a list of numbers (nums), as the only argument to the function. Take each number in
the list and square it if it is even, or square root the number if it is odd. Take this new list and return the sum of it, rounded to two decimal places.

The list will never be empty and will only contain values that are greater than or equal to zero.hat are not common
in the two strings.

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def sum_square_even_root_odd(nums):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
print (sum_square_even_root_odd(nums))
```

### 13) Jaden Casing Strings (7 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/5390bac347d09b7da40006f6>

**Tags:** Fundamentals, Strings, Arrays

**Instructions:**

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013).
Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known
for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions
are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from
Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

**Example:**

	Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
	Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def to_jaden_case(string):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
string = "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
print(to_jaden_case(string))
```

### 14) List Filtering (7 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/53dbd5315a3c69eed20002dd>

**Tags:** Fundamentals, Lists, Data Structures, Filtering, Algorithms

**Instructions:**

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list
with the strings filtered out.

**Examples:**

	filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
	filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
	filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def filter_list(l):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
l = [1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]
print(filter_list(l))
```

### 15) Highest and Lowest (7 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/554b4ac871d6813a03000035>

**Tags:** Fundamentals, Strings

**Instructions:**

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

**Examples:**

	high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
	high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
	high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"

Notes:

All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def high_and_low(numbers): 
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
numbers = "1 2 3 4 5"
print(high_and_low(numbers))
```

### 16) ORing arrays (7 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ac5e9aa3853da25d9000102>

Tags: Fundamentals, Arrays, Lists, Data Structures, Bitwise Operators, Bits, Operators, Advanced Language Features

**Instructions:**

It started as a discussion with a friend, who didn't fully grasp some way of setting defaults, but I thought the idea was cool enough for a beginner kata: binary OR each matching element of two given arrays (or lists, if you do it in Python; vectors in c++) of integers and give the resulting ORed array [starts to sound like a tonguetwister, doesn't it?].

If one array is shorter than the other, use the optional third parameter (defaulted to 0) to OR the unmatched elements.

**Examples:**

	or_arrays([1,2,3],[1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]
	or_arrays([1,2,3],[4,5,6]) == [5,7,7]
	or_arrays([1,2,3],[1,2]) == [1,2,3]
	or_arrays([1,2],[1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]
	or_arrays([1,2,3],[1,2,3],3) == [1,2,3]

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def or_arrays(arr1, arr2, arr3=''):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
arr1 = [1,2,3]
arr2 = [1,2,3]
print(or_arrays(arr1,arr2))
```

### 17) Multiples of 3 and 5 (6 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006>

**Tags:** Algorithms, Mathematics, Numbers

**Instructions:**

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these
multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0-

**Solution(List Comprehension - slow):**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def solution1(number):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(solution1(100))
```

**Solution(Math - fast):**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def solution2(number):
    ...
    
def sum_numbers(number):
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(solution2(100))
```

### 18) Your order, please (6 Kyu)

<https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c45be3b2079eccff00010f>

**Tags:** Fundamentals, Strings

**Instructions:**

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position 
the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive
numbers.

**Examples:**

	"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
	"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
	""  -->  ""

**Solution:**

```{code-cell} ipython3
def order(sentence):
    ...
  
def sorting(word): 
    ...
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sentence = "is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"
print(order(sentence))
```
